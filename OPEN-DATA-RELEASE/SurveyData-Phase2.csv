The Scorsese review was a little harder because most of the review was spent recalling the events of the movie, but by the end it was clear to me that the writer appreciated what Scorsese had to say.","It was very apparent if the writer liked or disliked the movie. They emphasized the things that they liked or didn't like. For positive reviews, words and phrases like excellent, unusually creative, imaginative, great acting and story, etc. were repeated throughout the review.

I tried the select phrases that were relevant to movies - so anything to do with acting, production, storytelling, and so on.","There were some phrases that in context very clearly meant something negative or positive. However, sometimes they were very sarcastic so they would give the opposite meaning, or the phrases were very long, convoluted analogies that wouldn't make much sense if you broke them down.","I think it would be helpful to define whether or not context matters for the opposite sentiment part. For example, ""awfully good"" is positive, but the word ""awfully"" by itself is very negative.","Typically, I skimmed through the review once more and selected words and phrases starting from the beginning of the review through to the end.",Somewhat agree,"For selecting words and phrases that matched the correct sentiment, I didn't focus too much on sentiment.

2021-09-01 15:40:16,Disagree,"For the most part, the reviews were straightforward. They either said that they liked the film or they didn't. There was only one instance where the review was more of a summary of a director's perspectives and life, which made it difficult to tell whether or not it was a positive review or not.","I mostly just read the review, honestly. It was easy to tell just through their sentences and words whether or not they liked a film. I did, however, spend time re-reading everything to make sure I didn't misunderstand sarcasm. For the most part, everything was straightforward.","I focused on big sentences that declared how good or bad the person regarding the film. Sentences like, 'This was the worst film ever!' helped in immediately determining that a review is negative. I also focused on other positive or negative individual words that made it clearer what type of review it was.","It was mostly clear. There was just the one review that mostly talked about the director --where it was a bit unclear whether or not the person found the ""movie"" positive or negative-- that made me wish there were more instructions about what to do in that particular situation. But for the most part, the instructions were fine.",Agree,"It was easy to spot positive and negative words and phrases to highlight. There were just a handful of times where I wasn't sure whether to include entire sentences or just separate phrases. Other times, I wasn't sure whether to just have the individual word or if I should include the surrounding phrase for better context. I just didn't want my highlights to seem overly bulky. There were some instances where just about every sentence could've been highlighted, but I wanted to reduce the amount of highlights to just get straight to the point. That was the only thing that was maybe a little tricky at times.","I would go through the entire review one sentence at a time and highlight words and phrases that I found positive or negative, depending on what I had selected on the previous screen. I would sometimes have to go back and undo things. Sometimes I would reduce the amount I highlighted in order to just highlight phrases instead of entire sentences. For the most part, I was just looking for keywords and key phrases that would stand out to a hypothetical person reading my highlights who wanted to read some quick main points.","In the case of positive reviews, I would select very upbeat or happy words and phrases. For negative reviews, I would select words and phrases that criticize or straight-up insult the film.","I remember wanting to select an entire sentence, but it seemed too bulky. It was in one of those reviews where just about every sentence seemed like it could've been highlighted. I didn't want to go overboard --and I also wasn't sure in that particular case whether or not to highlight the entire sentence or just the phrase-- so I went back and undid the highlight in favor of highlighting just individual phrases within the sentence to make it feel neater and more to-the-point.","The instructions were fine. It was mostly just my subjective desire to make the highlights more cleaner --to reduce bulk-- that slowed myself down. I guess some instructions that say I don't have to worry about being too precise would've helped, but it's not super necessary.","I just selected words and phrases as I went along with reading/re-reading the review. In order to understand the review correctly, I had to read from the beginning to the end.",Agree,"If there are blatantly obvious phrases like, ""Terrible film!"" then that would also imply the same sentiment if they appeared in other reviews. In other cases, I had to be careful to not highlights certain things. There may have been some cases where there was either sarcasm or words/phrases that were used in different contexts. I made sure not to highlight something like, 'The good news is, this terrible film is better than the 1997 version!"" The review is negative, so I only highlighted words and phrases that went along with the negative sentiment. I did only put ""Agree"" to the above question since focusing on ""other reviews"" wasn't my main objective. I was mostly focusing on a the reviews at hand, and I thought about highlighting important words and phrases that would help a hypothetical person looking at my highlights to determine whether or not they should watch the film.",The user interfaces were fine.
