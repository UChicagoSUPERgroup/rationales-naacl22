A lot of the reviews were very easy as they would have pretty hyperbolic first or last sentences (greatest movie, highly recommend to anyone vs boycott this movie, worst ever etc).

2021-09-07 17:27:03,Disagree,"It was quite easy to make a judgement as to whether a review was positive or negative as most of the reviews contained very emotive language. For example, negatives reviews contained superlatives such as 'the worst' and adjectives such as 'awful'. The repeated use of positive or negative terminology throughout the review allowed me to make a clear judgement.

The only exception to this was when the reviewer was making comparisons between bad past movies, and the good movie they were reviewing.","I would try to get a rough idea of how many positive and negative adjectives the reviewer had used throughout their review. Then, I would judge whether they had used more positive, or more negative, adjectives. If they had used more negative adjectives, I would class it as a negative review, and the same for positive reviews with positive adjectives.","If the reviewer capitalised entire words and used negative superlatives such as 'the worst', I would judge it as negative. I found that positive reviews were less likely to capitalise entire words than positive reviews.

With positive reviews, I found that they were more likely to use repeated punctuation, such as multiple exclamation points.","I think it would have been better if the instructions had specified whether the reviewer had a positive opinion about the film now, or when they first saw it.
