There was another which was someone describing a film which was nostalgic to them, but that whose special effects had maybe not aged well, but in the end nostalgia is a generally positive emotion, so it was a positive feeling review with a caveat.

2021-08-22 13:50:28,Somewhat agree,"Many of them were straightforward and gave a very good intent on what they thought. But some of them were more neutral in nature, not so much giving their thoughts on the firm but information and context behind it, yes there were hints and tones of what they thought but it was far from concrete. It really could of gone either way, depending on how you looked at it. ","To determine what direction a review was going I would first read the whole review. After that I would go back and look at the overall tone of the review, the wording used in a positive or negative light by the author. Then I took into account How they started and ended the review, because while the context of the review of a movie can be negative. Their thoughts of what it was could be the opposite, you have to look at the key words that they used, and if that fell into a positive light or negative. I focused mostly on what feelings conveyed were.","I focused on the starting and ending of a review. While the middle can contact useful parts, it also normally contains the context of the actual movie. The context of the movie can be negative, yet the reviewer was positive towards it.(or vise versa) So I looked to the authors thought and feelings in the beginning and ending of each review as a main focus.","This is a hard one to answer because I understand what you mean originally, but it is also hard to convey exactly what you mean. The way I took the instructions was that a positive review was positive from the author's perspective, even if they viewed the context of the movie negatively. If they thought it was a good movie, worth watching, good qualities of film, and so on it was positive. If they thought it was negative, would not recommend, did not like the acting, directing, and so it was negative. It really has nothing to do with if the movie it self is actually bad or good, it is just what the author thinks in regard to that. Sorry if I am not making sense here.",Agree,"Selecting words and phrases was the hardest part of this for me because you have to take into account the context in the way the words were used. Yes the author could be saying something is negative like abuse. But that had nothing to do with how they felt about the movie, it was just a description of the story. It was not meant to be in a negative light. The hardest part of this was the huge info dump review, it was very hard to discern a opinion out of all the info, and how that info actually related context wise.","I tried to select descriptive or feeling type words. Stuff along the lines of good, bad, annoying, great. These give a direction for you to go in, then I would go with phases that would give a greater context, such as ""worse movie ever"" or ""Best movie ever"". I would then go back and try to include anything related to the discretions, such as the 'acting was great' or ""the performance was the best"". Lastly I had to add some full sentences because with out the context of the whole sentence it did not make sense. Something along the lines of "" the actor seemed very bored in this role, I know because I was too!"" That sentence gave huge context to how the author felt, but a small highlight was not going to cut it.","The most important characteristics were descriptions of feelings. This is the way I felt, I felt this way too, things along those lines. Followed by statements that can only be taken in one way "" This is the best movie ever"" or ""this is the worst movie ever"". ","There were a few that I thought were important but the wording seemed off to me. In the large info dump review, there were alot of stuff that seemed important to the reviewer but did not exactly give context to what he saw or thought of what he saw. It was more a statement of fact over a opinion. ","This is about the same as the last one. It is not that is is not clear, it is that you have to take into account context of what the person means, and that is not always clear. It was hard to discern a lot of this for me, I do not know how to make it more clear without being convoluted. ","I selected words that were descriptive first, followed by easy to make out feelings. Then I looked for statements that were clearly defined to ones perspective. Followed by ones that were not so defined. Lastly I looked over context to make sure they were in line with the rest of the highlighted words and phrases. ",Somewhat disagree,"The above statement is not exactly true. Yes, it could be true in some context, or some reviews. But in other reviews the context of the movie could be negative, bad, or something in that regard, while the review is positive. In those cases or in  inverse using the same words would give you the opposite of the reviewers opinion. ","The highlighting part of this study was a bit unresponsive at times, it was annoying to connect phrases together. I had to many times redo them until the words linked correctly. No other errors were encountered. ",25 - 34,Man,,,,,,,White or Caucasian,,,,"Some college credit, no degree",,Yes,No,Yes,"I had a IT support job in college. It was technical support, and most likely not related to this. Mostly fixing software errors, software updates, server updates, hardware errors, hardware replacement.

This was a fun study overall,  thank you for putting the effort in. ",67258,I give permission for the data collected in this study to be released (without any identifiers) as part of a research data set. (Optional),"
